# NOTICE
# This is not your usual luacheck workflow! Don't copy this to other projects.
# Instead of installing and using this somewhere, we're actually building and
# running the current HEAD version on ourselves: basically this is a combination
# bootstrap test and dogfooding. The upshot is that we both check that
# everything works (and end-to-end test) and thata the current codebase lints
# against itself. This ensures we can fix a bug or make a breaking change in
# lualink without being blocked by CI using a different luacheck verision.
